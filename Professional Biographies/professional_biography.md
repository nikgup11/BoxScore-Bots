## Project Sought
I'm Looking for a machine learning focused project, preferably centered around analyzing and predicting sports statistics. I would like to possibly build a user friendly interfact such as a website or phone app for this. I think it could be interesting to present some new ways to visualize the data for users as well that may be more interpretable.
