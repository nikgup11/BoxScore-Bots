**Project Abstract**
Boxscore Bots is a machine-learning sports line predictor using public player and team stats to generate performance projections based on trends and matchup data. A web-based interface will provide easy use, and we will compare our projections with existing sports-betting lines to highlight what we believe are favorable bets.
