# How-To
The main page of this site is the table. It is a searchable and sortable excel-like table that allows you to look through our projections and filter by most points, most rebounds, most assists, or highest projected pra (points + rebounds + assists). 
This is the main purpose of the site. There will also be pages dedicated to tracking overall model accuracy and our projections insight on the biggest differences between the projection and actual sportsbook line.
